### Introduction to Javascript:
- When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

- Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

- Google debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, introducing the V8 JavaScript engine that was at the time much faster than its competition.

- The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

- Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:
   V8 in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
   SpiderMonkey in Firefox.
   SquirrelFish for Safari, etc.  

## How do engines work?
 Engines are complicated, just focus on basics
 - Engines which run in the browser parses the script(JS code)
 - Then it compiles into machine level language
 - Then the machine code runs fast
The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process. It even watches the compiled script as it runs, analyzes the data that flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on that knowledge.
